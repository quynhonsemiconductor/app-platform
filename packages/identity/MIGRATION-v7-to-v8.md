# Migrating `@quynhonsemiconductor/identity` from 7.x to 8.0.0

8.0.0 is a rewrite on Better Auth. Nothing from 7.x is source-compatible. Browser sessions become database
sessions behind an `HttpOnly` cookie; there is no access token, refresh token or BFF orchestrator any more.
Order of adoption (identity plan §13): LMS first, then opshub, then rova (solodesk was in this order until it
was retired on 2026-10-10). Renovate never auto-merges this major, so each product moves on its own schedule while 7.x keeps working.

7.x does not receive new features. A 7.x patch needs a maintenance branch (see the PR description).

## What you add

1. **Dependencies:** `@quynhonsemiconductor/platform-db` (>= 0.1.1), `platform-cache` (>= 3.1), `platform-http` (>= 4.1),
   `drizzle-orm`, `pg`, `fastify`. Do not depend on `better-auth` yourself.
2. **Environment:** `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` (32+ chars) and, with the `organizations` preset, `IDENTITY_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
   (32 random bytes, base64) — both from Key Vault through External Secrets. Remove the v7 JWT key and BFF secrets.
3. **Email and jobs:** a `JobEnqueue` binding (`platform-jobs`) and your `AuthEmailTemplates`. Auth emails are enqueued. **Only the `public` preset sends mail**: a `staff` or `organizations` only product leaves `mail` out (a boot error says so if `public` is configured without it).
4. **Tables** (below) and one `createIdentity()` call (README).
5. **Entra:** the staff app registration must be **single-tenant**, emit the `email` optional claim, and have
   `https://<api>/api/auth/callback/microsoft` as a redirect URI. Decide `staff.allowGuests` (rova: `true`, opshub: `false`).
6. **Frontend:** use `better-auth/react` `createAuthClient` against `/api/auth/*`; delete MSAL silent re-auth. A Microsoft
   sign-in is a server-side redirect.
7. **Lint:** forbid `better-auth` imports outside the file that calls `createIdentity` (identity plan I7).

## If the same change moves you to pnpm 11: registry authentication

Independent of identity, but it bites at exactly this kind of upgrade, so it is recorded here. **pnpm 11 ignores
a token in a project `.npmrc`** and answers `ERR_PNPM_FETCH_401` for `@quynhonsemiconductor/*`. rova and opshub
both authenticate that way today (`//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${NODE_AUTH_TOKEN}` in `.npmrc`), and CI runs
pnpm 10, so nothing is broken yet (solodesk did the same and pinned `pnpm@10.23.0`; it was retired on 2026-10-10).
The first product to move to pnpm 11 fails in **three** places, not one:

1. **Developer machines:** put the token in `~/.npmrc` (`( umask 077; printf '//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=%s\n' "$TOKEN" >> ~/.npmrc )`)
   and delete the token line from the project `.npmrc`, leaving only the registry line.
2. **GitHub Actions:** `actions/setup-node` with `registry-url: https://npm.pkg.github.com`, `scope: '@quynhonsemiconductor'`
   and `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` on the install step. **The shared `setup-node-pnpm` action in `quynhonsemiconductor/ci` does not
   do this**: it calls `actions/setup-node` without `registry-url` and runs `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` itself, so it
   relies on the product's project `.npmrc` and will 401 on pnpm 11. Until that action writes a user-level npmrc (a change
   in the `ci` repository, not here), write one yourself in a step before it, or run the install outside the action
   (`install-deps: 'false'`).
3. **Docker builds:** rova's and opshub's Dockerfiles `COPY .npmrc` and `export NODE_AUTH_TOKEN="$(cat /run/secrets/node_auth_token)"`
   in front of `pnpm install`. On pnpm 11 that 401s. Write `~/.npmrc` from the secret inside the same `RUN` and remove
   it afterwards: `( umask 077; printf '//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=%s\n' "$(cat /run/secrets/node_auth_token)" > "$HOME/.npmrc" ) && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && rm -f "$HOME/.npmrc"`.

Every form was run on pnpm 10.33.2 and 11.28.5 from a clean `HOME`, and the Docker form in a BuildKit build on both
(the current pattern installs on 10 and gets 401 on 11; the fix installs on both). The details and the other forms are in
the root [README](../../README.md#authenticating-to-github-packages).

## If your Docker image runs `pnpm install --prod`: add `.pnpmfile.cjs`

Better Auth's 18 optional peers (`vitest`, `drizzle-kit`, `react`, `next`, `prisma` ...) are matched to your `devDependencies` and recorded
as optional dependencies, which `--prod` follows: the image gains vitest, drizzle-kit and esbuild's Go binary (Trivy
CVE-2025-68121 in opshub). Add the `.pnpmfile.cjs` that identity ships (required on pnpm 10, defensive on pnpm 11), **copy it into every Docker stage that
installs**, run `pnpm install`, and check `pnpm why esbuild vitest --prod` is empty. The file, the check and what else was tried:
[Keeping Better Auth's optional peers out of the runtime image](README.md#keeping-better-auths-optional-peers-out-of-the-runtime-image).

## Tables and data

Generate the Better Auth tables for your instance (README, "Tables"), then migrate in one transaction. Ids are
preserved, so foreign keys to `identity.users.id` keep working.

WHERE s.provider = 'entra';
COMMIT;
```

Check before cutover: no two v7 users share a lower-cased email (v8 requires it to be unique); the only rows
that should not copy are the ones you meant to exclude.

### A migrated user must be verified, and a guest needs their account row

Two rules of the sign-in make the migration order-sensitive. Both were found while planning rova's migration:

1. **Do not copy the v7 `email_verified`; set `true`.** When a Microsoft member signs in, the package deletes an existing user for that address
   that is **unverified, holds no non-credential account and has no session row** (the squatting rule, plan D10), then signs the person in as
   a NEW user with a NEW id. A migrated user starts with no v8 session, so an unverified one with no account would be deleted on first
   sign-in and every foreign key to its old id would dangle. A user with a Microsoft account row is never replaceable, but for a user
   without one, `email_verified = true` is what protects the id. For a tenant member that is true by definition (the tenant vouches for
   the address); the v7 flag meant "this user has signed in before", which is not the question v8 asks.
2. **Migrate every Entra identity into `account`.** A B2B guest (`staff.allowGuests: true`) whose address already belongs to a v8
   `user` is **refused with `ACCOUNT_LINK_REQUIRED`** unless that user already holds the same `(microsoft, oid)` account: a guest never
   auto-links. So a guest who has signed in before keeps signing in only if their `sso_identities` row became an `account` row. A user who has
   **no** Entra identity and an address off `staff.domains` (an invitee who never signed in) should **not** be copied: with no row, the first
   sign-in creates the user; with a row and no account, it is refused. Check for them before you migrate (rova expects none).

Write the migration as a preflight that RAISES (duplicate lower-cased emails, identities of a provider you cannot map, a user with two
Entra identities, users in the second class above), then the inserts, then an assertion that compares the SETS of ids (`EXCEPT` both ways),
not just counts. Make the inserts idempotent (`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, `NOT EXISTS`) so they can be re-run at cutover to pick up users
created in v7 in the meantime.

### SSO providers and their secrets

A partner IdP is registered by an organization owner or admin through the application, or by your admin tool
calling the same API, so the client secret passes through the encrypting adapter. If you must write
`sso_provider.oidc_config` yourself (a one-off script), seal the secret with the package's helper, never store
it plain:

```ts
import { sealSsoClientSecret } from '@quynhonsemiconductor/identity';

const sealed = sealSsoClientSecret(plainSecret); // `enc:v1:…`, key from IDENTITY_ENCRYPTION_KEY
```

Set `domain_verified` only after the DNS proof, and expect a provider whose domain is not verified to be unusable.
v7 `sso_connections` stored a secret reference, not the secret; fetch the secret from where that reference points.

solodesk (retired 2026-10-10; kept as the worked example of an argon2 product): users and Google identities map
the same way. Existing argon2 password hashes (any parameters) verify as they are, so password users do **not** have to reset; hashes in another format will fail with a plain 401 and
need a reset.

## Behaviour changes to design for

- **Claims and workspace context.** v7 put `contextId` and claims in the access token. v8 has no token for browsers:
  read permissions from your own tables per request (cache briefly in Valkey). The active context lives on the session as
  `contextId` from **8.4**: the `context` option, `POST /api/auth/context/set`, `setContext`, `clearContext*` (README,
  "The active context of a session"). rova's `switch-workspace` becomes a call to `setContext`; its `workspace_members` lookup is
  the `membership` port, and removing a member calls `clearContext`. Per-workspace SSO is a separate matter (organizations
  preset) and is not part of 8.4.
- **Other credentials on the same routes** (rova's `Bearer rly_…` API tokens): `SessionGuard` is global and would answer 401 to
  them. Authenticate them in a guard of your own, registered before `IdentityModule`, write the principal, and call
  `markPreAuthenticated(req)` (8.4; README, "A credential that is not a browser session").
- **No refresh-token theft detection.** Cookie sessions have no refresh token. Mitigations: `HttpOnly` cookie, session
  list, short staff sessions (12 h), no cookie cache for staff, immediate revocation.
- **Revocation window.** With the public cookie cache (5 min) a revoked session can still be believed for up to 5 minutes.
  Staff instances have no cache.
- **Service-to-service tokens** were never browser sessions; if you verified v7 ES256 tokens elsewhere, that needs the
  `jwt` plugin, which is **not** in 8.0.0.
- **Rate limiting** moves into Valkey (`platform-cache`) and keys on `clientIp()`; fail-open when Valkey is down.
- **Failed email enqueue does not fail the request.** Better Auth swallows a throwing callback; the user can use "resend".

## Rollback

Redeploy the previous image. v7 tables are untouched; keep them read-only for 30 days, then drop them.
