# QNSC platform runtime contract

**Status:** v1.2 (2026-10-10: the four open questions are decided, and the correlation id ships in `platform-http`; see [Decisions](#decisions-on-the-questions-found-while-deriving-this-document)) · derived from the packages **as merged on `main`** (2026-10-09):
`platform-db` 0.1.1 · `platform-runtime` 0.1.3 · `platform-http` 4.1.x · `platform-cache` 3.1.x ·
`observability` 0.2.x · `identity` 7.1.0 (8.0.0 pending) — plus [ADR 0001](adr/0001-job-queue.md),
[ADR 0002](adr/0002-identity-v8-better-auth.md) and [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) §4 for what is decided but not yet built.

This is the contract every QNSC service honours, whatever its language. TypeScript services get most
of it from the `@quynhonsemiconductor/*` packages; a Python (or any other) service implements the same
behaviour itself and is checked against [§17](#17-conformance-checklist). **The contract is the
behaviour, not the library**: where this document and a package disagree, that is a bug in one of them
and is fixed in the same change.

> **Reading the requirement words.** MUST / MUST NOT are conformance requirements. SHOULD is a
> requirement with a documented reason to deviate. "Reference" names where the TypeScript behaviour is
> implemented.

Items still waiting on a work package are marked **Pending WP-n** with what is already decided, so a
service written today does not have to guess.

## 1. Process model

- One image per service. The same image runs as the API and as the worker; **`ROLE=worker`** selects the
  worker. Anything else is the API. (Reference: `platform-jobs` — [§13](#13-async-work).)
- The API process MUST NOT run background handlers. It MAY enqueue work.
- One worker deployment per product, running all of that product's queues.
- Containers are `linux/amd64` and read configuration **from the environment**, plus files the
  environment points at (such as `DATABASE_SSL_CA`).

## 2. Health

| Route         | Meaning                                                                                    | Status                                                           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /livez`  | The process is running.                                                                    | `200 {"status":"ok"}`                                            |
| `GET /readyz` | The process can serve traffic: its dependencies are reachable and it is not shutting down. | `200` when every check is up, `503` when any is down or draining |

Rules:

- **`/livez` MUST NOT touch any dependency.** Liveness that checks the database restarts every replica at
  once when the database slows down. The platform's admission policy
  (`gitops/platform/policy/admission.yaml`) **rejects** a Deployment whose liveness path is anything other
  than exactly `/livez`.
- `/livez` and `/readyz` MUST be served **unprefixed** (`/livez`, never `/v1/livez`), **without
  authentication**, outside the rate limiter, and outside the OpenAPI document.
- `/readyz` MUST return `503` for the whole of the shutdown sequence ([§3](#3-shutdown)).
- Response body of `/readyz`: `{ "status": "ok"|"error", "shuttingDown": boolean, "checks": { "<name>": "up"|"down" } }`
  (while draining: `status: "error"`, `shuttingDown: true`, `checks: {}`). The cause of a failed check MUST be **logged, never returned**: the endpoint is unauthenticated and
  host or role names do not belong in it.
- All checks together MUST answer within **800 ms**. The chart leaves the readiness probe at
  Kubernetes' default 1 s `timeoutSeconds`; a hung dependency reads as that check being `down`, not as a
  probe timeout. Checks are cheap — they run every few seconds on every replica.
- Built-in checks (TypeScript): `database` (when a pool exists) and `cache` (when a cache is
  configured; `optional` mode without a URL is not checked).
- Compatibility aliases `GET /v1/healthz` (= `/livez`) and `GET /v1/readyz` (= `/readyz`) exist while
  the ECS/ALB estate does. New services SHOULD NOT add them.
- Probe, health and favicon requests MUST NOT create trace spans and MUST NOT appear in access logs
  ([§5](#5-telemetry), [§4](#4-logs)). The one list is `PROBE_PATHS`: `/livez`, `/readyz`, `/v1/readyz`,
  `/healthz`, `/v1/healthz` (plus `/favicon.ico`), matched on the whole path with the query string
  removed, never as a prefix.

Reference: `platform-runtime` `enableHealth(app, { checks? })`; `observability` `PROBE_PATHS`,
`isIgnoredRequestPath`.

## 3. Shutdown

On `SIGTERM` (and `SIGINT`) a service MUST, in this order:

1. start answering `/readyz` with `503` (the pod leaves its Service);
2. keep serving for the **endpoint-removal delay**, so requests already routed to it still land
   (`/livez` stays `200` throughout);
3. stop accepting connections and wait for in-flight requests; close idle keep-alive connections;
4. **stop work before releasing the resources the work uses**: job runners and consumers stop first,
   then database pools and cache clients are closed;
5. flush telemetry, then exit `0`.

The whole sequence is bounded. Past the deadline the process MUST exit `1` rather than wait for the
kubelet's `SIGKILL`.

| Variable                     | Default                   | Meaning                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_MS`        | `25000`                   | Hard deadline. MUST stay below the chart's `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` (default 30 s); raise them together.               |
| `SHUTDOWN_ENDPOINT_DELAY_MS` | `5000` in a pod, else `0` | How long to keep serving after going not-ready. "In a pod" means `KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST` is set. MUST be below the timeout. |

Both are integers; a malformed value or a delay at or above the deadline is a startup error.

- A service MUST NOT install its own `SIGTERM` handler alongside the shared one (a second handler runs
  `close()` immediately, with no readiness flip, no delay and no drain).
- A shutdown hook that throws MUST NOT prevent the hooks after it from running; catch and log inside
  hooks. (In NestJS a throwing hook ends the whole close sequence.)
- A job interrupted by a drain past the grace period costs that job one retry ([§13](#13-async-work)).

Reference: `platform-runtime` `enableGracefulShutdown(app)`. Resource release belongs in
`onApplicationShutdown` (pools: `platform-db`; cache: `platform-cache` ≥ 3.1.1).

## 4. Logs

- **JSON lines on stdout.** One object per line. No log files, no shipping from inside the service —
  the platform collects stdout.
- Every line MUST carry: `time`, `level`, `msg`, `service`, `env`, `version`.
  - `service` — the service name (`rova-api`, `rova-worker`); `env` — `NODE_ENV`/deployment
    environment; `version` — `SERVICE_VERSION` (the release tag, set by CI; `dev` if unset).
  - The TypeScript reference (pino) writes `time` as epoch milliseconds and `level` on pino's numeric
    scale (10 trace … 60 fatal). Another implementation SHOULD use the same representation so one
    collector pipeline parses both.
- When a span is active a line MUST carry **`trace.id`** and **`span.id`** (W3C hex ids, the dotted
  names as shown) so a log links to its trace. _(Decided 2026-10-10, [Q3](#decisions-on-the-questions-found-while-deriving-this-document):
  the logger's dotted names stay. The plan's draft used `trace_id`/`span_id`; a non-TypeScript service
  uses the dotted names so one collector pipeline joins them.)_
- When known, a line SHOULD carry `correlationId`, `userId`, `workspaceId`. **Background work MUST seed
  its own correlation id** (job name + random suffix, for example `daily-cleanup:8f3a…`), or its lines
  carry none. Work that started in a request carries the request's id through its payload.
- **No secrets and no personal data.** The redaction list is part of the contract and applies in every
  environment: `req.headers.authorization`, `req.headers.cookie`, `res.headers["set-cookie"]`,
  `req.headers["x-api-key"]`, `req.headers["x-csrf-token"]`, and the same headers nested inside SDK
  error objects (`err.config.headers.authorization`, `err.request.headers.authorization`), replaced by
  `[REDACTED]`. A worker has no inbound request, so its SDK errors are the realistic leak path; it uses
  the same factory as the API.
- One request-summary line per request, emitted by the application (the framework's automatic request
  logging is off, to avoid a duplicate). It carries method, URL, status code, duration, `userId`,
  `correlationId` and the client IP ([§8](#8-client-ip)). Probe paths are skipped ([§2](#2-health)).
- **Security fail-open events** carry the literal field **`securityFailOpen`** with one of `denylist`,
  `rate_limit`, `authz_epoch`, `authz_epoch_bump`. Alerts match that literal; renaming it silently
  disarms them. It is paired with the `security.fail_open` metric ([§5](#5-telemetry)).

Reference: `observability` `createLoggerOptions`, `failOpenLog`, `FAIL_OPEN_FIELD`, `withJobContext`.

## 5. Telemetry

OpenTelemetry, OTLP over HTTP, to the collector (Alloy) — usually a sidecar or node agent.

| Variable                                         | Default                 | Meaning                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OTEL_ENABLED`                                   | `false`                 | Must be exactly `true` to start. Off means no SDK, not a broken one.                                        |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`                    | `http://localhost:4318` | Base URL; traces go to `/v1/traces`.                                                                        |
| `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`                              | the service's own name  | Worker processes use their own name (`OTEL_WORKER_SERVICE_NAME` in the reference).                          |
| `OTEL_SERVICE_NAMESPACE`                         | `qnsc`                  | Groups every product under one label for cross-product queries.                                             |
| `OTEL_SAMPLING_PROBABILITY`                      | `1.0` dev / `0.1` prod  | Head sampling, `parentbased_traceidratio`. Not a number → default plus a warning (never "drop everything"). |
| `DEPLOYMENT_ENV`                                 | `NODE_ENV`              | `deployment.environment`; `production` selects the `0.1` default.                                           |
| `SERVICE_VERSION`                                | `dev`                   | `service.version`. Set from the release tag in CI, or telemetry is unattributable.                          |
| `K8S_POD_NAME`, `K8S_NAMESPACE`, `K8S_NODE_NAME` | —                       | Downward API → `k8s.pod.name`, `k8s.namespace.name`, `k8s.node.name`; added only when non-blank.            |

- Resource attributes: `service.name`, `service.version`, `deployment.environment.name`,
  `service.namespace`, `service.instance.id` (unique per container), and the `k8s.*` above.
- The standard sampler variables (`OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER`, `…_ARG`) are **ignored**; the table above is
  the interface. Head sampling below `1.0` drops most error traces — prefer collector-side tail
  sampling (100 % of errors and slow traces) and leave this at `1.0` where the collector does it.
- Instrumentation is on for HTTP, PostgreSQL and the cache client, **off** for filesystem, DNS, raw
  sockets and the AWS SDK (object storage is plain HTTP and is already traced).
- Telemetry MUST NOT break the request: recording a metric or span can cost a data point, never a
  response. (`observability`'s recorders catch and log once.)

**Metrics** (names are part of the contract: dashboards and alerts are built on them).

| Instrument                                                           | Kind                | Notes                                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `http.server.requests`, `http.server.errors`, `http.server.duration` | counter / histogram | RED per route. Duration in ms; see the bucket warning in the `observability` README.           |
| `job.runs`, `job.failures`, `job.duration`, `job.unlocked_runs`      | counter / histogram | `job.unlocked_runs > 0` with more than one replica means a scheduled job ran on every replica. |
| `queue.processed`, `queue.failures`, `queue.lag_seconds`             | counter / gauge     | Lag, not throughput, reveals a consumer falling behind.                                        |
| `db.pool.in_use`, `db.pool.waiting`                                  | gauge               | Registered once; pulled on collection.                                                         |
| `security.fail_open`, `auth.login`, `authz.stale_token`              | counter             | Pairs with the `securityFailOpen` log field.                                                   |

**Labels are bounded.** Status collapses to `2xx/3xx/4xx/5xx`; method to a fixed set plus `OTHER`;
ids never appear as labels (they belong on spans and logs). Where the type system cannot enforce it,
distinct values per label are capped — `route` 500, `error_code` 200, `job` and `queue` 100 — and
further values are recorded as `__other__`. A request that matches **no route** (a scanner, a typo)
MUST be labelled with the constant **`unmatched`**, never its raw URL, or scanner traffic alone spends
the route budget. The caps are tripwires, not settings; there is deliberately no per-product override.

`LabelCardinalityGuard`.

## 6. Environment names

Names are a contract with the `qnsc-service` chart. **A rename on either side is a cross-repo break**:
change the chart and the package in the same release window. Unset means "use the default"; a
required variable that is missing is a **startup error that names the variable**.

| Group      | Variable                                                                                        | Default                                       | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

¹ Not needed when `DATABASE_SSL=disable`.

Rules for names a service adds:

- A product's own variables are its vocabulary and stay in its `env.schema`; this table is only what
  the **platform** reads or injects.
- Validate at startup with a multi-error message (all problems at once), not at first use.
- Load `.env` for local development **before** the telemetry bootstrap, and let a real environment
  variable always win over the file. (`platform-runtime/load-env`; a file read after the bootstrap made
  `OTEL_ENABLED=true` read as unset in production-like runs.)

## 7. Errors and HTTP behaviour

Every error response is one envelope. **Frontends branch on `code`, never on `message`.**

```json
{ "error": { "code": "VALIDATION_FAILED", "message": "…", "details": [], "correlationId": "…" } }
```

- `details` is always an array (empty when there is nothing to add). `correlationId` is the request's
  correlation id, `unknown` if none was seeded.
- Internal detail (stack traces, SQL, host names) MUST NOT reach the wire. An unhandled error is
  `500 INTERNAL_ERROR` with the message `An unexpected error occurred`; the detail is logged.
- Categories map to a fixed status, so the same condition is the same status in every product:

| Category            | Status |     | Category              | Status |
| ------------------- | ------ | --- | --------------------- | ------ |
| `NOT_FOUND`         | 404    |     | `PRECONDITION_FAILED` | 412    |
| `CONFLICT`          | 409    |     | `RATE_LIMITED`        | 429    |
| `VALIDATION_FAILED` | 422    |     | `UNAUTHORIZED`        | 401    |
| `PERMISSION_DENIED` | 403    |     | `INTERNAL`            | 500    |

- **Transport-level codes** emitted by the platform itself (a product adds its own domain codes on top,
  append-only; a code is never renamed or reused):
  `INTERNAL_ERROR`, `VALIDATION_FAILED`, `RATE_LIMITED`, `INVALID_CURSOR`, `UNAUTHORIZED`, `FORBIDDEN`,
  `NOT_FOUND`, `BAD_REQUEST`, `METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED`, `CONFLICT`, `PRECONDITION_FAILED`,
  `PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE`, `UNSUPPORTED_MEDIA_TYPE`, `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`.
- A status raised by the framework maps to the code of the same name above; any other status is
  `INTERNAL_ERROR`. `503` is `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`, which means "a dependency or optional integration is
  not available, including not configured" — it MUST NOT be reported as `INTERNAL_ERROR`, which says the
  service is broken when it is only switched off.
- Validation failures are `422` with the field-level issues in `details`.
- **Security-relevant statuses (401, 403, 429) are logged at warn** with the code and, when known, the
  user id, so anomaly detection can alert on them.
- **Pagination:** cursor pagination takes `limit` (1..100, default 50), `cursor`
  (opaque, base64url) and `sort`, and returns `{ data: [...], pageInfo: { nextCursor, hasNextPage, limit } }`.
  A malformed cursor is `422 INVALID_CURSOR`.
- **Correlation id.** A request carries exactly one id, from its first byte to its last log line.
  - **Header:** `X-Correlation-Id`, on the request and echoed on the response.
  - **Accepted from the caller** only if it is a single header value of **1 to 128 characters from
    `[A-Za-z0-9._:-]`**. Anything else (empty, longer, a space, a quote, a control character, CR/LF, a
    repeated header) is **replaced** by a freshly generated id (a random UUID, `crypto.randomUUID()` in
    the TypeScript reference). A service MUST NOT put an unvalidated caller value in a log line or a
    response header: the id is untrusted input on both paths, and CR/LF in it forges log records and
    splits headers. The character class is deliberate: a UUID-only rule would discard the ULIDs, hex
    trace ids and `service:request` composites that real callers send and break correlation across a
    call chain.
  - **Absent:** an HTTP service MUST generate one. (Row 17 of the checklist tests exactly this.)
  - A replacement is logged at DEBUG with the **reason and the length** of the rejected value, never
    the value.
  - **The context is per request.** Every request gets its own; one request's context (its id, its user)
    MUST NOT be reachable from another's, including when the server itself was started inside a context.
  - **The id is in the request context**, so it is on every log line as `correlationId` ([§4](#4-logs)),
    in every error body ([above](#7-errors-and-http-behaviour)), and available to code through the
    request-context accessor.
  - **Background work** continues the id of the request that caused it: put `correlationId` in the job
    payload when enqueuing, and restore it when the handler starts (the TypeScript reference:
    `withJobContext(name, fn, { correlationId })`). Work that did not start in a request gets its own,
    prefixed with the job name ([§4](#4-logs)).
  - Reference: `platform-http` `enableCorrelationId(app)` (4.2.0). `CORRELATION_ID_MODE=disabled` turns
    it off for a deployment whose product still seeds the id itself ([§6](#6-environment-names)).
- **Retry-safe writes:** `Idempotency-Key` on `POST`/`PUT` ([§9](#9-rate-limiting-and-idempotency)).

Reference: `platform-http` `DomainException` and subclasses, `GlobalExceptionFilter`, `HttpErrorCodes`,
`CATEGORY_HTTP_STATUS`.

## 8. Client IP

The client address is, in order:

1. the **signed edge address** (`x-qnsc-edge-ip`), only when `EDGE_CLIENT_IP_SECRET` is set and the
   signature verifies for this request (below);
2. `cf-connecting-ip`, if present and a literal IP address;
3. the first `x-forwarded-for` entry that is a literal IP address;
4. the socket address.

A header value that is not a literal IP is skipped, not trusted. Behind Cloudflare Tunnel the socket
address is `cloudflared`'s, and the first `x-forwarded-for` entry is whatever the client sent;
Cloudflare overwrites `cf-connecting-ip`, so a forged `x-forwarded-for` is ignored whenever it is
present.

> **Assumption.** This is authoritative only if the pods are reachable **only** through the Cloudflare
> Tunnel and the gateway behind it: no public listener, no `NodePort`. Otherwise a caller chooses its
> own address, and with it its own rate-limit bucket. The platform (not the service) guarantees this.
> The origin MUST accept Cloudflare traffic only: through the Tunnel, or with an allow-list of
> Cloudflare's published ranges. **The signed edge address does not replace this**: it stops a forged
> header, not a caller who bypasses the edge.

**Behind a Cloudflare Worker or Pages Function.** What `cf-connecting-ip` holds depends on the path.
Only the first case is something this platform has relied on; the others are from Cloudflare's
documentation or unverified, and none was observed against a live Worker or Pages Function:

- no Worker in the path: the visitor's address;
- a **Worker** in the **same zone** as the API calling it with `fetch()`: documented by Cloudflare to
  reflect `x-real-ip`, the visitor's address. **Unverified here.**
- a **Pages Function**: **unverified, assume `2a06:98c0:3600::103`.** A Pages Function on a custom domain
  probably runs in Pages' zone, not the API's, so its subrequest is cross-zone; community reports say the
  API then sees that address;
- a Worker or Pages Function calling an API in **another** zone: documented by Cloudflare: **the same
  Cloudflare-internal address for every user** (`2a06:98c0:3600::103`).

Assume the last address. Nothing fails: every user shares one rate-limit bucket and one `ip` in the log
(the authentication library's 3-per-10-seconds credential limit becomes 3 per 10 seconds for the whole
company). A header the Worker sets (`x-client-ip`, `x-forwarded-for`) is **not** a trusted source on its
own: to the API it is only a header, settable by any caller that reaches it. Check a new deployment once:
the `ip` of the request-summary log line must be the visitor's address.

To keep the visitor's address behind a Worker or Pages Function, the Worker **signs** it
(`@quynhonsemiconductor/platform-http/edge`, `forwardToOrigin`; it forwards an allow-list of the visitor's
headers and uses `redirect: 'manual'`, so the API's `/callback/*` 302 and its `Set-Cookie` reach the
browser untouched): it strips inbound `x-qnsc-edge-*`, then sets `x-qnsc-edge-ip` (the address of
`cf-connecting-ip`), `x-qnsc-edge-ts` (seconds) and
`x-qnsc-edge-sig` = `base64url(HMAC-SHA256(EDGE_CLIENT_IP_SECRET, "ts|ip|METHOD|path"))`. The API accepts
it only if the signature verifies in constant time for this request's method and path (query ignored),
`|now - ts| <= 60 s`, and the value is a literal IP. Anything else is ignored and the order falls back to
`cf-connecting-ip`. `EDGE_CLIENT_IP_SECRET_PREVIOUS` is accepted alongside the current one during a
rotation; the secret is trimmed on both ends; secrets under 32 characters stop the application starting
when `RateLimitGuard`, `IdempotencyInterceptor` or `HttpLoggingInterceptor` is registered (otherwise call
`assertEdgeClientIpEnv()`); `clientIp()` answers once per request; refused headers are counted as
`edge_client_ip.rejected{reason}`. A signature binds the request, not the sender: inside its minute the
same request can be repeated, as the same visitor. The alternative is to have the browser call the API
directly.

The same address MUST be used for the request log, rate-limit keys, the anonymous idempotency key and
authentication-library rate limits (identity v8: Better Auth reads one header, `x-qnsc-client-ip`, which
the identity mount fills from `clientIp()`, after discarding whatever the client sent under that name; it
does not read `cf-connecting-ip` itself).
Do not read `x-real-ip`.

Reference: `platform-http` `clientIp(req)`.

## 9. Rate limiting and idempotency

Both store their state in the cache, and both are **only as good as it**.

- **In production, a service that registers the rate-limit guard or the idempotency interceptor MUST
  fail at startup when no cache is configured**, unless it says on purpose that it does not need one:
  - `RATE_LIMIT_MODE=edge-only` — limits are enforced by Cloudflare rules only; the guard allows every
    request without touching the cache and logs a warning at startup;
  - `RATE_LIMIT_MODE=disabled` / `IDEMPOTENCY_MODE=disabled` — development and CI. In production a
    disabled limiter is a security control switched off, so it is reported as a fail-open: a startup
    warning carrying `securityFailOpen: "rate_limit"` and `security.fail_open` recorded at startup and on
    every request it lets through.
  - An unknown mode value is a startup error — a typo never silently means the default.
  - Outside production nothing changes (local development and CI run without a cache).
- A cache that exists but is **unreachable at request time fails open** (the request is allowed) and is
  reported the same two ways (`securityFailOpen: "rate_limit"`, `security.fail_open`). Recording that can
  never fail the request.
- **Algorithm:** atomic sliding-window log (server-side script), not a fixed window, so there is no burst
  at the boundary. Response headers: `RateLimit-Limit`, `RateLimit-Remaining`, `RateLimit-Reset` (Unix
  seconds), and `Retry-After` (seconds) on `429`.
- **Tiers are named by intent.** The platform ships the mechanism and these defaults; which route gets
  which tier is the product's policy.

| Tier                        | Limit                                                                        |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DEFAULT`                   | 100 / minute                                                                 |
| `STRICT` (sensitive writes) | 20 / minute                                                                  |
| `AUTH_LOGIN`                | 5 / 15 minutes, per IP                                                       |
| `AUTH_REFRESH`              | 30 / minute, per session (SHA-256 of the refresh cookie), falling back to IP |

- **Idempotency:** `Idempotency-Key` on `POST`/`PUT`. The first call runs and its response is stored;
  a repeat with the same key returns the stored response (it is not re-executed). The stored entry is
  scoped to user, method, URL and key; an anonymous caller is identified by a hash of client IP and
  user agent. A cache failure never fails the request.

Reference: `platform-http` `RateLimitGuard`, `IdempotencyInterceptor`, `RATE_LIMIT_TIERS`.

## 10. Database

PostgreSQL, one CloudNativePG cluster per product in production (one shared cluster with a database per
product in dev). Roles `<product>_app` and `<product>_migrator`.

- **Password auth only**, with the credentials CloudNativePG generates inside the cluster. No IAM and
  no cloud token. A rotation needs a rolling restart.
- **TLS is verified, always:** the server certificate is checked against `DATABASE_SSL_CA` **and** the
  name in `DATABASE_HOST`, so connect by the cluster service name, not a pod IP. A server presenting
  another CA or name is refused; a server that offers no TLS is refused, never downgraded. There is no
  "skip verification" setting. The one exception, `DATABASE_SSL=disable`, exists for a laptop and makes
  the process **refuse to start** under `NODE_ENV=production`.
- **Pool:** sized by `DB_POOL_MAX` (default 10). Total connections `replicas × DB_POOL_MAX` stay under
  the role's `CONNECTION LIMIT`. A dropped connection (failover, drain, switchover) MUST NOT crash the
  process: it logs a warning, the query on it fails normally, and the pool discards the client.
- **Connection failures name their cause** instead of a bare driver code: `AUTH_FAILED`,
  `TLS_UNTRUSTED_CA`, `TLS_CERT_INVALID`, `TLS_NOT_OFFERED`, `CONNECTION_LIMIT`, `CONNECT_TIMEOUT`,
  `UNREACHABLE`; a configuration problem found before connecting is a startup error naming the variable.
- **Boot:** a configuration error fails the boot; an unreachable database at boot is **logged, not
  fatal** — `/readyz` is what gates traffic.
- **Transactions:** one contract. A unit of work takes either the root database or an open transaction
  (`DbExecutor`); `withTransaction` opens one from the root and **joins** an open one (no savepoint, no
  commit of its own), and refuses transaction options when joining rather than silently running at a
  weaker isolation. **Never call an external provider (mail, HTTP, an LLM) inside a transaction.**
- **Leader locks without a cache** use a session-scoped Postgres advisory lock, taken with the
  non-blocking call; a crashed holder frees it on the server.
- **Migrations** run as a separate Job under the migrator role, never from the serving process.
- **Read replica** (`DATABASE_READ_HOST`) is optional; plain reads route to it, writes and transactions
  to the primary.
- Pooling beyond the role limit is the CNPG-managed PgBouncer `Pooler`, added only when
  `replicas × DB_POOL_MAX` approaches the limit.

Reference: `platform-db` (`createPool`, `pingDatabase`, `withAdvisoryLock`, `DbExecutor`,
`withTransaction`; Drizzle at `/drizzle`, NestJS at `/nest`).

## 11. Cache

Valkey, **one per product** in production, one shared in dev. The product's own instance: sessions and
rate-limit state are never shared across products. Keys carry a per-product prefix.

- Mode `required` (default): a missing URL is a startup error. Mode `optional`: a missing URL disables
  the cache and every operation no-ops — which is exactly why [§9](#9-rate-limiting-and-idempotency)
  refuses `optional`-without-URL in production for rate limiting and idempotency.
- The client connects eagerly and auto-pipelines commands issued in the same tick.
- **The cache is never the source of truth.** Anything in it can be lost; the database is authoritative.
  Cache invalidation is synchronous after commit and best-effort, with a TTL as the backstop.
  - _One deliberate exception in kind, not in rule:_ `platform-mail`'s **send ledger and pacing state**
    live here ([§14](#14-email)). They are a **guard**, not a record: if they are lost the worst case is
    one duplicate email, never a lost one, and the database still holds the job. They are not in the
    database because the alternative, `jobs.once`, would hold a transaction open across the call to the
    mail provider ([§13](#13-async-work) rule 2).
- **Locks** are `SET NX PX` with an expiry, so a crashed holder cannot deadlock a job, and a **random owner token**:
  `CacheService.tryLock` returns a lock whose `release()` / `extend()` are compare-and-delete / compare-and-expire, so a
  holder that overran its lease cannot free the lock of the one that took over. The lease must still exceed the work.
- The client is released **after** work that uses it has stopped ([§3](#3-shutdown)).
- Pub/sub is for ephemeral realtime signals only ([§13](#13-async-work)).

Reference: `platform-cache` `CacheService`.

## 12. Authentication

The platform shares the **mechanism**; **authorization** (roles, permissions, scopes, guards) is product
vocabulary and stays in the product.

- **Staff** sign in with Microsoft Entra ID (OIDC, authorization code with PKCE and single-use `state`).
  The tenant is checked (`tid` equals the configured tenant). Whether B2B guests of that tenant may sign
  in is product policy (default: no).
- **Service-to-service** calls use the internal network plus a **per-service token**. Never the staff
  login, never a shared token between services.
- Sessions for browsers are **opaque and server-side** (BFF); tokens are not handed to JavaScript.
  Refresh tokens rotate on every use with family-level theft detection: reuse of a rotated token
  revokes the family.
- Logout and offboarding are effective immediately through a denylist in the cache. **The denylist is
  a fail-open control** and is reported as such (`securityFailOpen: "denylist"`, [§4](#4-logs)).
- Login failures collapse to one response to the browser (no IdP or internal detail); the
  `auth.login` metric is where "is login itself working" is answered ([§5](#5-telemetry)).
- Passwords (where a product has them): argon2id; a login for an account that does not exist costs the
  same time as one that does.

### Current state and what is pending

|                                             | State                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `identity` 7.1.0 (Passport/JWT, BFF, Entra) | Shipped; the products run it.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `identity` 8.0.0 on Better Auth             | **Pending WP-10.** ADR 0002 passed all ten spike criteria; manual checks **M1–M4** against the real QNSC tenant must pass before release, and **M6** re-runs the email-callback criterion once WP-7/WP-8 exist. |

Already decided for 8.0.0 ([ADR 0002](adr/0002-identity-v8-better-auth.md), decisions 1–6), so a
service written now can rely on them:

- SSO provider client secrets are **encrypted in the column** (AES-256-GCM, `enc:v1:` prefix = key
  version), key from `IDENTITY_ENCRYPTION_KEY`; plain text is never logged or returned.
- **Squatting:** password sign-up is refused for the staff domain(s) and any domain an organisation has
  verified for SSO; an unverified password account is replaced when a provider asserting a verified
  email signs in for the same address; unverified accounts are purged after **72 hours** by a scheduled
  job.
- Only an organisation owner/admin can register an SSO provider, and only for a verified domain.
- Reset and verification links are bearer tokens in clear in the `mail.send` job row: completed jobs are
  deleted at once, failed ones kept at most **24 hours**, reset tokens live **15 minutes**.
- Auth emails are **enqueued and never awaited**, so response time does not reveal whether an account
  exists. Enqueue is inside the sign-up transaction (the one place Better Auth runs a callback inside
  its transaction); every other email callback runs outside any transaction.
- Rate-limit counters live in the cache; the client address is [§8](#8-client-ip).

## 13. Async work

**Two mechanisms only.** Durable work goes through Postgres; ephemeral signals go through the cache.

| Mechanism              | For                                                                                                               | Guarantee                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Postgres job queue** | Anything that **must** happen: email, SMS, outbound webhooks, AI/OCR/transcode, fan-out, calls to another product | Durable; enqueued **in the business transaction** (rollback ⇒ no job); at-least-once; retries with backoff; dead-letter   |
| **Valkey pub/sub**     | Ephemeral realtime signals to browsers (SSE)                                                                      | Best-effort. The database is the source of truth; a client that reconnects resumes from `Last-Event-ID` or "unread since" |

The job table lives in the **product's own database** and is written in the same transaction, so it is
the outbox: **no `*_outbox` tables, no relay loops, no relay wake channels in new code.** No Kafka,
RabbitMQ or SQS.

**Rules (every service):**

1. **Handlers are idempotent.** Delivery is at-least-once. Check the idempotency key before the side
   effect.
2. **Never call an external provider inside an open database transaction.** Enqueue instead.
3. **The API process only enqueues.** Handlers and schedules run only when `ROLE=worker`.
4. **A drain costs the interrupted job one attempt**, so every queue allows at least one retry. A queue
   that must not retry declares it and accepts dead-lettering on a drain.
5. A user who is waiting (OTP, email verification, password reset) is still served by a job, picked up
   within about **1 s** (per-queue polling interval); the UI says "sent" and offers "resend" after 60 s.
6. Do synchronously only what the user needs **and** touches only the product's own database:

| Work                                 | Pattern                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| In-app notification, few recipients  | Insert in the business transaction; publish on pub/sub after commit                                      |
| In-app notification, many recipients | One fan-out job enqueued in the transaction; the worker writes in batches                                |
| Email, SMS                           | A job, always, with an idempotency key per message                                                       |
| Outbound webhook                     | A job with retries, backoff and an HMAC signature                                                        |
| Call to another product              | A job calling its internal API                                                                           |
| LLM, OCR, embeddings, transcoding    | A job; a separate worker deployment only when resource needs differ                                      |
| PDF                                  | Synchronous only if it finishes in under ~3 s with the user waiting; otherwise a job plus a notification |
| Audit log                            | **Synchronous, in the same transaction** — it must never be lost                                         |
| Cache invalidation                   | Synchronous after commit, best-effort                                                                    |

7. **"This notification must be synchronous"** has two readings. If the user is merely waiting, see rule 5. If the business step is valid only once delivery succeeded (rare): commit state `pending_notify`,
   call the sender directly in the request with a ~5 s timeout, set `notified` on success, and on failure
   return a clear error **and** leave a retry job; the business step proceeds only from `notified`.
8. SSE routes send a heartbeat every **30 s** and the route MUST disable the gateway's request timeout.

### `platform-jobs` (WP-7)

Decided in [ADR 0001](adr/0001-job-queue.md) and its amendment of 2026-10-10 (pg-boss; verdict PASS);
implemented by WP-7, not yet released:

- API: `jobs.send(queue, data, { tx, idempotencyKey, startAfter, priority })`, `jobs.handle(queue, handler, options)`,
  `jobs.schedule(name, cron, data, { tz })`. Products never import the queue library.
- **Idempotency key → job id** (not a singleton key); a duplicate key inserts nothing. `send` without `tx`
  commits on the jobs pool's own connection, independently of any transaction you have open.
- Handlers are at-least-once and MUST be idempotent. `jobs.once(db, key, effect)` guards a **database**
  effect (savepoint, one transaction). It is **never** for an external call: that needs its own claim
  ledger, as `platform-mail` does ([§14](#14-email)).
- `PermanentJobError` from a handler dead-letters the job at once, with no retries.
- `jobs.redrive(dlq, { limit, filter })` moves dead-letter copies back to their origin queue with a fresh retry
  budget and the **same job id** (so `idempotencyKey` still deduplicates), atomically per job, and returns
  `{ moved, skipped }`; it refuses a queue that is not a dead-letter queue. Only a `failed` original is replaced.
  The origin queue's `canRedrive` rule is enforced in code: authentication mail is never redriven.
- Schedules default to `Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh`. One execution per tick across any number of workers.
- A job that nobody processes is deleted after `retention.pending` (default pg-boss's 14 days; set it for a
  queue whose payload must not linger): the deadline is fixed when the job is inserted, **a retry does not
  extend it**, a job being processed is never deleted by it, there is no dead-letter copy, and a worker
  reports what it drops, best effort and as a lower bound (a warning with a count per queue, never a
  payload; `queue.pending_dropped`; pg-boss's own 15-minute maintenance deletes silently too).
- Per-queue **retention** defaults: completed 7 days; failed follows completed (pg-boss keeps finished
  jobs on one clock); the dead-letter copy 30 days. `mail.send`: completed deleted immediately, failed
  at most 24 h — and because deleting a completed job also drops the job-id dedupe, its handler keeps its
  own idempotency store.
- Fetching is batched with burst (`concurrency` jobs in flight, run as one batch); long jobs use a 30 s
  heartbeat. `retryLimit` minimum is 1 (a pod drain spends an attempt). Each job is completed as soon as
  its handler returns, so a drain never re-runs a job that had finished.
- A dead worker's job is noticed after its lease or heartbeat **plus up to ~75 s** (the queue's monitor
  pass); the platform accepts this.
- The app role never owns the queue schema (the migrator does, through `installJobsSchema`); queue
  statistics come from telemetry, not from the queue's own stats table.
- Telemetry on the contract names ([§5](#5-telemetry)): `queue.processed`, `queue.failures`,
  `queue.lag_seconds` (the age of the oldest ready job); pg-boss's `pgboss.*` instruments and
  `pgboss.queue.oldest_ready_age` and `queue.pending_dropped` (jobs deleted unprocessed past
  `retention.pending`: a lower bound, alert on it) are extras. Handler logs carry the correlation id the sender put in the payload as
  `correlationId` ([§7](#7-errors-and-http-behaviour); valid per the same rule: 1–128 of `[A-Za-z0-9._:-]`), else
  `queue:jobId`. It is explicit, never injected into the data (`currentCorrelationId()` reads it for senders).
- One worker replica per product; alert on queue depth and oldest-job age. **No KEDA.**
- `platform-runtime`'s `ExclusiveJob` is **deprecated** in favour of schedules and is removed in the
  next major, after every product has converged.

## 14. Email

**All product email goes through Microsoft 365 (Graph `sendMail`), from one mailbox per product.** One
Entra app per product (its existing login app), limited to that mailbox by **Exchange Online RBAC for
Applications**; no tenant-wide `Mail.Send`.

- A product sends as `noreply-<product>@qnsc.vn`. Exchange limits are **per mailbox** (about 30 messages
  a minute, 10,000 recipients a day, 2,000 external recipients per 24 hours), so one mailbox per product
  gives each its own quota and isolates a sending block.
- Email is a **job**, always ([§13](#13-async-work)), with an idempotency key per message, rate-limited to
  about **20 messages a minute per sending mailbox**; a `429` is retried honouring `Retry-After`, and a
  `5xx` with backoff.
- **In-app first.** Email only for important events, with per-user preferences. **Digest batching**
  instead of one email per event (especially rova).
- **Never marketing or newsletters through M365** (Microsoft's terms; domain reputation). Marketing, if a
  product ever needs it, uses a separate transport and domain.
- **System alerts** (Proxmox, PBS, Grafana, Healthchecks) do not use product mailboxes.
- **Transports** are chosen by `MAIL_TRANSPORT`: `graph` (the only production transport) and `smtp`
  (non-production only; the process refuses to load it when `NODE_ENV=production`). Cloudflare Email
  Service and Resend are _future_ transports behind the same contract, built per product only on a
  trigger (about 1,000 external emails a day, a Microsoft sending restriction, or a marketing need).
- Templates and rendering are the product's. The platform receives finished HTML and text.
- No bounce or complaint processing yet; non-delivery reports land in each product mailbox.

### Per-environment mail policy

Decided for **every** product (2026-10-11):

| Environment     | Transport                       | Mailbox                     | Who receives it                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **dev / local** | `MAIL_TRANSPORT=smtp` → Mailpit | none                        | **nobody**: Mailpit keeps every message; nothing is delivered    |
| **prod**        | `graph`                         | `noreply-<product>@qnsc.vn` | real recipients; a **post-deploy smoke test** after every deploy |

**A non-prod app never uses a prod mailbox.** There is no staging: dev sends through Mailpit and has no
mailbox at all, and the production mailbox's Exchange scope names only the production app, so any other
app that tries it gets a `403`, not a delivered email.

> **Mailpit is a mailbox for secrets, not a toy.** It stores every message in clear — password-reset
> and verification **links included** — and has **no login** unless you add one. Whoever can open its web
> UI can take over any account whose link it holds. **Never expose it publicly:** no Cloudflare Tunnel
> route, no public Ingress or `NodePort`, no port published on a shared host. Reach it from inside the
> cluster or with `kubectl port-forward`. It is for dev and local only.

- **Post-deploy smoke test (prod).** After every deploy a step runs
  `platform-mail-smoke` inside the product image (a Kubernetes post-install/post-upgrade Job, or a CI
  step that `exec`s into a pod). It builds the sender from the same environment as the app, sends **one**
  message directly (not through the queue, so it proves the Graph path even when no worker runs) to
  `MAIL_SMOKE_TO`, and exits `0` only on success. `MAIL_SMOKE_TO` is required and its domain must be
  exactly `qnsc.vn`: the smoke test never emails anyone else. It refuses `smtp` in production. Exit
  codes tell the failures apart: `2` configuration, `3` authentication, `4` **403 — the Exchange
  scope is wrong**, `5` throttled, `6` sender mailbox not found, `1` anything else. It prints the
  code, the status and the provider's request id, never a token or a body.

### `platform-mail` (WP-8)

Implemented by `@quynhonsemiconductor/platform-mail` (0.1.x, not yet released); its README is the
detail, this is the behaviour a service in any language must match.

- **Contract.** `send(message) → { id, transport }`, with `message` = `to, cc?, bcc?, replyTo?, from?,
subject, html, text, headers?, category, idempotencyKey, correlationId?`. Addresses are bare
  `local@domain` (no display names, no control characters); at most 500 recipients; `from` is the
  configured mailbox or omitted; `headers` are `x-` only and never `X-MS-Exchange-*` or
  `X-Microsoft-*`; `category` is lower-case words (`auth.verify-email`) because it is a metric label;
  `correlationId` follows [§7](#7-errors-and-http-behaviour). A message is validated before any
  network call or database write; an error never contains the subject, a recipient, the body or a
  credential.
- **`graph`.** `POST /users/{MAIL_GRAPH_SENDER}/sendMail`, `saveToSentItems: false`, an app-only token
  from workload identity federation (`AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE`); a client secret is refused in
  production. Graph's JSON body carries one part, so the **HTML is sent and the plain-text
  alternative is not**. Inside one send, `429`, `502`, `503` and `504` — responses on which Graph did
  not accept the message — are retried up to 3 attempts, honouring `Retry-After` up to 30 s, else
  backoff with jitter. A timeout or a `500` is not retried in place: the message may have been
  accepted.
- **The `mail.send` queue.** One definition (`MAIL_QUEUE_CONFIG`) used by the worker and by every
  process that only enqueues: completed jobs deleted at once, failed and dead-lettered kept at most
  24 h (the payload carries bearer links; **an unprocessed job too**, `retention.pending`, not pg-boss's
  14 days), a 300 s lease with a 30 s heartbeat, **10 retries from 10 s
  doubling to 15 min — at least an hour in the worst case** — so a ten-minute cache outage or sustained
  throttling does not dead-letter a password reset. **Priority:** `auth.*` messages are 10, everything
  else 0, and bulk mail stays at 0. A failure retrying cannot fix (HTTP 400, 403, 404, 413, an invalid
  message) is a `PermanentJobError`: dead-lettered at once, no retries. Alert on the dead-letter
  queue's depth (`pgboss.queue.jobs{queue="mail.send.dlq",state="ready"} > 0`); authentication mail
  is never redriven (its link expires and the user asks again), and `platform-mail` enforces it in the queue
  definition.
- **Pacing.** About **20 messages a minute per sender mailbox** (a bucket of 20 a minute with a burst
  of 5, so at most 25 in any minute, under Exchange's ~30), shared by every worker. A `429` starts a
  **mailbox-wide cooldown** for its `Retry-After` (60 s if none, at most 10 min) that every worker
  honours before sending. `Retry-After` does not reschedule the job.
- **Idempotency.** The handler claims a ledger entry for the message (the sender mailbox and a hash of
  `idempotencyKey`) **before** it sends, keeps the claim alive (60 s lease, renewed every 30 s) while the
  send runs so a killed worker's claim lapses within a minute, records the delivery after, and releases
  the claim on failure: a duplicate key is one email, whether the message was enqueued twice, the job was delivered
  twice or two workers raced. It is at-least-once, not exactly-once: Graph has no idempotency key, so
  a lost acknowledgement can send a message twice, which is the chosen failure for authentication
  mail (a duplicate over a lost link).
- **The ledger is in the product's Valkey, not in `jobs.once`.** `once()` runs its effect inside a
  database transaction and holds it, and the row lock, for as long as the effect runs; an HTTP call to
  Graph there is exactly what [§13](#13-async-work) rule 2 forbids, and it could not be made atomic
  with the marker anyway. A service in another language keeps the same claim → call → record ledger
  wherever it keeps fast, expiring state. Losing it can cause one duplicate email, never a lost one
  (see the note in [§11](#11-cache)).
- **Drain.** The job's abort signal ends a Graph request at every stage: before the request is sent
  nothing is sent and the claim is released; once it is on the wire a lost acknowledgement still means a
  second send (at-least-once, accepted).
- **Correlation.** The worker continues the `correlationId` of the request that queued the email
  ([§7](#7-errors-and-http-behaviour)); without one the job's own `mail.send:<jobId>` applies.
- **Telemetry.** `mail.sent`, `mail.duplicates`, `mail.failures` (labels `category`, closed `code`, plus `in_flight` for an attempt that met another attempt's claim),
  `mail.pacing_wait_ms`. Log lines carry the category and the error code, never an address.
- The manual check — one product's mailbox succeeds and another product's mailbox returns `403` — is
  run by the owner with real credentials ([package README](../packages/platform-mail/README.md)).

## 15. AI

Every LLM, embedding and transcription call goes through **LiteLLM**, with the **product's virtual
key**. There is no AI client library: policy is enforced at the gateway, so it covers every language.

- `LITELLM_BASE_URL` and `LITELLM_API_KEY` (the product's virtual key). Budgets, tier routing and the
  hosted-model data rule are enforced by LiteLLM per key, not by client code.
- **Model aliases** (stable names; a model behind an alias can change, the alias cannot):
  `tier-l`, `tier-s`, `tier-m`, `tier-xl` (chat tiers), `embed-e5-v1` (embeddings), `whisper-v1`
  (transcription).
- Send **`metadata.feature`** on every call, so spend is attributed to a feature.
- **Restricted data** goes only to keys and models flagged local. Never to a hosted model.
- **Changing the embedding model means a new alias** (`embed-…-v2`) **and a re-embedding plan** — never a
  silent swap, because vectors from two models are not comparable.
- TEI, Whisper, clamd and Gotenberg are plain HTTP from the product (TEI and Whisper through LiteLLM);
  there is nothing to share.

## 16. Not part of the contract

Stated so nobody looks for them here:

- Email templates, notification templates and tables, permission codes, roles, routes, DTOs, Drizzle
  tables, policy values (limits per route, schedules, TTLs). Product vocabulary — never shared
  ([ADMISSION-TEST.md](ADMISSION-TEST.md)).
- **Object storage.** Products keep their S3-API code against R2; a shared package is a P2 evaluation
  (WP-17) and storage is not part of this contract until it is measured.
- **Realtime push** implementation (pub/sub + SSE) and **resilience** helpers (retry, circuit breaker).
  Product code; WP-16 evaluates the first.
- **Python libraries.** A Python service follows this document directly; a shared Python package is
  written only when two Python services need the same code.

## 17. Conformance checklist

A service conforms when every line is true. For TypeScript services most are given by the packages;
for any other language each is the service's own to implement and demonstrate.

| #   | Requirement                                                                                                                                                               | How to check                                                     |

## 18. Changing this contract

- It is derived from the code. When a package changes behaviour this document describes, the same pull
  request updates this document; when the document is wrong, the fix is in whichever of the two is
  wrong.
- A **rename or removal** of an environment variable, a log field, a metric name, an error code or a
  route is a cross-repo break: it needs the chart, the dashboards and the alerts changed in the same
  release window, and a deprecation period when a running product would otherwise break.
- Additions are free. Error codes and metric names are append-only.

## Decisions on the questions found while deriving this document

These were open in v1.0 and were decided by the platform lead on 2026-10-10. The numbers are this
document's own (the plan's §11 has Q5–Q8 for the same decisions).

- **Q1 — the cache variable: `REDIS_URL`.** rova and opshub already read it and the chart injects it.
  The plan's earlier `VALKEY_URL` is dropped. No package reads it; the product passes the value to
  `CacheModule`.
- **Q2 — correlation id: a `platform-http` follow-up. Delivered:** `enableCorrelationId(app)` seeds the
  request context from `X-Correlation-Id` and generates an id when the header is absent or invalid
  ([§7](#7-errors-and-http-behaviour)). The products' own middleware can now be removed, at their pace.
- **Q3 — log trace fields stay `trace.id` / `span.id`.** The plan's `trace_id` / `span_id` is dropped; a
  service in another language emits the dotted names.
- **Q4 — `S3_*` waits for WP-17.** Storage stays product-owned, with per-product variable names, until it
  is measured.
