/**
 * OpenTelemetry bootstrap — the single implementation, shared by every app.
 *
 * Every product had one copy of this per process (api, worker), byte-for-byte the
 * same except for the service name — so sampling policy, exporter tuning, resource
 * attributes and shutdown logic were maintained N times per repo and again in each
 * repo. Each entrypoint is now a thin shim that calls {@link startOtel} with its
 * own name.
 *
 * IMPORT DISCIPLINE — this file must only import `@opentelemetry/*` and node
 * built-ins, and consumers must import it via the `@quynhonsemiconductor/observability/otel`
 * subpath rather than the package root. Auto-instrumentation patches modules as
 * they are required, so anything that pulls in Nest, pg, or ioredis *before*
 * `startOtel()` runs would be loaded unpatched and silently produce no spans.
 *
 * A no-op unless `OTEL_ENABLED=true`, so adopting this package changes nothing
 * until a collector endpoint exists to receive the data.

   * WHY THIS EXISTS. The OTel JS default explicit-histogram boundaries end at 10000:
   * `[0, 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 2500, 5000, 7500, 10000]`

   * slower than 10s lands in the same overflow bucket, and `histogram_quantile`
   * clamps to the largest finite boundary — so a p99 alert on a product whose slow
   * requests take three minutes fires with the value `10000`, which is not a latency
   * at all, and a 12s request is arithmetically indistinguishable from a 180s one.
   *
   * That blind spot is real for a consumer whose request path wraps calls in
   * resilience presets with timeout budgets of 60s x 3 attempts: those requests
   * return 200, so the 5xx alert never sees them either. Such a product needs
   * boundaries that reach past its own worst-case budget.
   *
   * OPT-IN ON PURPOSE, not a new default. Changing the buckets changes the shape of
   * the exported `_bucket` series — an existing recording rule, dashboard or alert
   * built on the old boundaries goes stale the moment the new ones ship. That is a
   * per-product rollout decision with a per-product blast radius, so it is a
   * per-product option rather than a package-wide default.
