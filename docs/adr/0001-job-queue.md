# 0001. Use pg-boss as the job queue behind `platform-jobs`

- **Status:** **Accepted** (2026-10-09, platform lead) — verdict **PASS**. WP-7 builds `platform-jobs` on pg-boss with the decisions below. **Amended 2026-10-10** (see _Amendment 2026-10-10_, which supersedes the earlier text where they differ).
- **Date:** 2026-10-09
- **Work package:** WP-6 (builds WP-7; informs WP-8 and WP-9)
- **Deciders:** platform lead (`@quynhonsemiconductor/platform-infra`)

## Context

`APP-PLATFORM-PLAN.md` §4 makes Postgres + pg-boss the only mechanism for work that must happen
(email, webhooks, AI/OCR/transcode, fan-out, calls to other products): enqueued in the business
transaction, at-least-once, retried with backoff, dead-lettered. `PORTFOLIO-TECH-REVIEW.md` §2A.6
made that adoption conditional on a two-day spike over seven scenarios; WP-6 adds two more:

- a per-queue polling interval of ≤ 1 s, measured end to end (the plan promises a user who is
  waiting for an OTP "picked up within ~1 s", and WP-7 accepts p95 ≤ 1.5 s);
- enqueue inside a Drizzle transaction through the `DbExecutor` of `platform-db` (0.1.1, on `main`).

The fallback if it fails is BullMQ on a persistent Valkey plus a Postgres outbox, behind the same
`platform-jobs` API (R1).

**What was run.** [`spikes/pg-boss/`](https://github.com/quynhonsemiconductor/app-platform/tree/19c6e309e66ae272a1d6cbf7a1b64b2179f81dff/spikes/pg-boss) (private, never published, not in the root `pnpm test`). It
uses pg-boss **12.37.0** — pinned exactly; 12.37.1 was published 2026-10-08 and the repo's pnpm
`minimumReleaseAge` refuses it until it has aged a day, so WP-7 starts from 12.37.0 or from
12.37.1 once that gate opens. The database is PostgreSQL 18 over **verified TLS** (a CA generated
per run) through `platform-db`'s `createPool`; pg-boss never opens a connection of its own.
Workers that are killed or drained are real OS processes, and "killed" means SIGKILL. Every
number below is in [`spikes/pg-boss/results/*.json`](https://github.com/quynhonsemiconductor/app-platform/tree/19c6e309e66ae272a1d6cbf7a1b64b2179f81dff/spikes/pg-boss/results), written by the runs themselves.

**Environment and its limits.** One developer machine (macOS, Docker Desktop VM, 12 CPUs), Node
24.11.1, Grafana 13.0.2. The load test's database was capped at 2 CPUs / 2 GiB. Nothing here ran
against CloudNativePG, Cloudflare Tunnel, Grafana Cloud, or a Kubernetes pod; those are listed
under _Not verified_.

## Decision

We will build `platform-jobs` (WP-7) on pg-boss, through the public API sketched below. All nine
checks passed; none needed a workaround that changes the architecture. They did surface findings (F1–F11)
that WP-7 must build in, because some pg-boss defaults are wrong for this platform (each is in
_Findings_ with the evidence). The most consequential three:

1. **A worker with pg-boss's defaults moves one job per second per queue**, whatever the polling
   interval: at 100 jobs/s the backlog grew by 99 jobs/s. Throughput is
   `batchSize × workers ÷ polling interval`, so `platform-jobs` must fetch in batches and burst.
2. **`persistQueueStats` cannot be used by a non-owner app role.** It works for two days, then
   every supervise pass fails (job expiry, retries and retention with it). Default it off; take
   metrics from OpenTelemetry.
3. **Draining a pod spends one retry.** A job interrupted by SIGTERM past the grace period is
   failed and re-queued; on a queue with `retryLimit: 0` it goes to the dead-letter queue instead.

Also checked, because WP-7 promises them: enqueue idempotency (`B-enqueue-idempotency`), least
privilege (`C-least-privilege`), packaging in a CommonJS package (`D-packaging`), and the cost of
the oldest-job-age metric (`E-oldest-age-query`).

## Findings

Each finding is what the platform has to do about something, with the evidence for it.

### Throughput, polling and latency

**F1 — Pickup latency meets the promise.** On an idle queue with a 1 s polling interval, in a
separate worker process, p50 / p95 / p99 pickup was 501 / 967 / 998 ms (n = 100, `created_on` → handler first line, both stamped by the database); the in-process figure is
535 / 989 / 1 018 ms (n = 150, producer clock). The theoretical floor is a uniform wait over the interval, so p95 ≈ 0.95 × interval
and p50 ≈ 0.5 ×. At the minimum interval (0.5 s) p95 was 508 ms. WP-7's "p95 ≤ 1.5 s with a 1 s
interval" holds with 0.5 s to spare. Six polling queues cost the database about 10 transactions
per second at idle.

**F2 — The default worker is a 1-job-per-second worker.** `batchSize` defaults to 1 and a worker
sleeps the polling interval between fetches, so one worker drains one job a second. With the
defaults and 100 jobs/s offered for 30 s, 31 jobs completed and 2 969 were still waiting
(`results/scenario-5.json`, `naiveDefaults`). With `batchSize: 25`, `localConcurrency: 2`,
`burstWhenBatchFull: true` on two workers, 60 000 of 60 000 completed. `platform-jobs` must
therefore fetch `batchSize = concurrency` and enable `burstWhenBatchFull`, so that a full batch is
followed immediately by another fetch. `burstWhenReadyExceeds` is not an alternative: it reads the
cached queue count, which is as stale as the supervise interval (F5).

**F3 — Load.** At 100 jobs/s for 600 s (30 % of enqueues inside a Drizzle transaction with a
business insert, 70 % direct), the producer kept its schedule to within 114 ms, the backlog stayed
between 0 and 98 (mean 50 in the middle third, 49 in the last), and the queue drained in 0.8 s
after the producer stopped. The database used a mean 22 % of one core (p95 27 %; one 5 s sample
reached 108 %), 110 MiB, and 18 MB for the job table and its indexes after 60 000 jobs. Autovacuum
ran 11 times and left 799 dead tuples. A worker process used about 1 % of a core. 100 jobs/s is
ten times the portfolio's peak (§2A.2), so this is a margin, not a sizing.

### Reliability

**F4 — Crash recovery depends on how the lease is configured, and the cost is in the lease.** A
killed worker's job is recovered only when its lease ends. With `expireInSeconds` alone the job is
re-leased when the lease expires, counted from the start of the attempt: in the 30-minute run (lease 45 min) the job came back 46.0 minutes after it started, 36 minutes after the kill — the lease plus up to one supervise pass (default 60 s). In the compressed run (40 s job, 60 s lease) it came back 93 s after it started.
With `heartbeatSeconds` the worker proves it is alive and the job is recovered within about one to
two heartbeats of the kill: with `heartbeatSeconds: 30` the job was re-leased 56.5 s after the kill and finished 30 minutes later (full run); with `heartbeatSeconds: 10` it took 63 s (compressed run). Both are dominated by the 60 s supervise interval the runs used, so F10's 15 s setting should shorten it to roughly a heartbeat plus 15 s (an expectation; not measured). For jobs longer than a few minutes `platform-jobs`
should set `heartbeatSeconds` (30 s) and a generous `expireInSeconds`; `expireInSeconds` is a
ceiling on a job's run time, not a recovery time. Neither variant ever ran a job twice
concurrently or completed it twice (checked by a side-effect row guarded by `ON CONFLICT`).

**F5 — Shutdown spends a retry.** On SIGTERM the worker stops fetching, waits for in-flight jobs up
to the `stop({ timeout })` budget, then fails what is left with `pg-boss shut down while active`.
The three 6 s jobs finished on the draining worker. The 45 s job was failed at 15.03 s (the budget
was 15 s) and started on another worker 16.0 s after SIGTERM with `retry_count = 1`. A job that
arrived after SIGTERM went to the other worker. On a queue with `retryLimit: 0` the same
interruption **fails the job terminally and dead-letters it**, and no other worker runs it
(`retryLimit0Drain`). WP-7 must (a) give every queue a `retryLimit` of at least 1, (b) set the
`stop` timeout to the pod grace period minus the endpoint-removal delay, and (c) say in the README
that a deploy can consume one retry of a long job.

**F6 — Idempotency is not what the plan assumed.** APP-PLATFORM-PLAN §6.7 says the idempotency key
"maps to pg-boss singleton/dedup key". Measured: `singletonKey` alone does **not** dedupe on a
standard queue (two sends, two jobs); with `singletonSeconds` it dedupes only inside the time slot.
What does dedupe is the job **id**: pg-boss lets the caller choose it, `(name, id)` is the primary
key, and a second `send` with the same id returns `null` and inserts nothing — also from inside a
transaction, also while the first job is `completed` and still retained, and a concurrent
duplicate **blocks until the first transaction commits or rolls back** (it waited 1.0 s in the
test) rather than both succeeding. So `idempotencyKey` maps to a deterministic UUIDv5 of
`(queue, key)` used as the job id. The guarantee lasts as long as the row does (`deleteAfterSeconds`,
7 days by default); a handler that must never act twice (email) still needs the handler-side
guard, and the spike's `runOnce` shows the shape: a marker row written in the same transaction as
the effect, or the provider's own idempotency key.

**F7 — Schedules.** Ten consecutive one-minute ticks with two worker processes, a third joining
after tick 3 and the oldest SIGKILLed after tick 6: every tick produced exactly one job and exactly one execution (10 of 10), ticks were consecutive minutes with none skipped, and the work was shared between replicas (7 executions on one, 3 on another). A job is created by a cron pass
(every 30 s, one instance per pass) _after_ its tick, with `start_after = created_on`, so a tick's
job is created up to 30 s late, and the tick it belongs to is the minute it was created in. A
`0 2 * * *` schedule with `tz: 'Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh'` previews as 19:00 UTC the day before, as
expected. Do not use a tick's job as a precise clock.

### Operations

**F8 — Least privilege: the app role needs less than assumed, and one option breaks it.** The
migrator installs the schema by running the SQL that pg-boss exports (`getConstructionPlans`) — no
pg-boss process is needed in the migration Job — and owns it. The app role then needs, and the
whole workload (send, work, retry, dead-letter, schedule, supervise, monitor, redrive, cancel,
`createQueue` for a shared-table queue) runs with, only:

```sql
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA pgboss TO app;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA pgboss TO app;
GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA pgboss TO app;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ROLE migrator IN SCHEMA pgboss
  GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON TABLES TO app;      -- tables a later release adds
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ROLE migrator IN SCHEMA pgboss
  GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON SEQUENCES TO app;
```

with `migrate: false, createSchema: false`. Without grants `start()` rejects with `permission
denied`. Against a schema older than the code, `start()` rejects with `pg-boss database requires
migrations` instead of running DDL. The app role cannot `DROP`, `ALTER`, `TRUNCATE` or `CREATE` in
the schema. Two options need more, and must not be used by `platform-jobs`:

- `createQueue(..., { partition: true })` needs `CREATE` on the schema (`permission denied for
schema pgboss`).
- `persistQueueStats: true` **works for two days and then breaks supervision.** The install plan
  creates the `queue_stats` partitions for today and tomorrow; after that each supervise pass runs
  `CREATE TABLE … PARTITION OF` (and `DROP TABLE` for retention) as the app role. Simulating the
  day after: `permission denied for schema pgboss`; with `CREATE ON SCHEMA` granted it becomes
  `must be owner of table queue_stats`. The failure is thrown before the pass reaches job expiry,
  retries or deletion, so it is not confined to statistics. Ownership through a shared NOLOGIN owner
  role makes it work, but the partitions are then owned by whichever role created them, so a later
  migration by the migrator would fail on them. WP-7 leaves `persistQueueStats` off.

**F9 — Without `persistQueueStats` the age of the oldest job is not available — but is cheap to
compute.** `pgboss.queue.ready_oldest_seconds` stays `NULL` and the built-in gauge has no age. The
query `SELECT name, now() - min(start_after) … WHERE name = ANY($1) AND state < 'active' AND NOT
blocked AND start_after <= now() GROUP BY name` uses pg-boss's own partial index
(`job_common_i11`): an index-only scan, 0.09 ms of execution and 0.6 ms round trip on a table of
1 000 000 completed rows plus 500 waiting. Without `NOT blocked` it is a sequential scan of 35 ms
that also launches parallel workers. `observability` registers it as an observable gauge.

**F10 — Metrics are fresh only as often as the supervise pass.** The queue counts behind the
`pgboss.queue.jobs` gauge and `pgboss.queue` are refreshed by the supervise pass, whose default
interval is 60 s; setting `monitorIntervalSeconds` or `queueCacheIntervalSeconds` smaller changes
nothing (the first run of the OpenTelemetry check read 0 for seven waiting jobs). Setting
`superviseIntervalSeconds` to 2–5 s made the gauge correct within one interval. `platform-jobs`
should use 15 s: the alerts it feeds (depth and age) are minutes-scale.

**F11 — Packaging.** pg-boss is ESM-only; this repo's packages are CommonJS compiled with
`moduleResolution: node`. `require('pg-boss')` works on Node 24.11.1 with nothing on stderr. A CJS
package compiled with the repo settings emits `require("pg-boss")` and pg-boss's types resolve
(they are real types, not `any`). **Without `skipLibCheck`, pg-boss's own `.d.ts` fails to compile
under node10 resolution (5 errors)**, so `platform-jobs` must not put pg-boss types in its public
declarations — which the "products never import `pg-boss`" rule already requires. Under
`node16` resolution a CJS file importing an ESM-only package is refused by the compiler (TS1479),
so a future move to `node16` in this repo needs the packages to go ESM or dual.

### Observability

**Scenario 6, SQL path.** `grafana/pgboss-queues.dashboard.json` has six panels, each one SQL
query: ready depth, oldest ready age, terminal failures per minute, active jobs, jobs retrying now,
dead-letter queues waiting. With a PostgreSQL data source over verified TLS (`verify-ca`) as a
read-only role (which can `SELECT` but is refused `DELETE` and `UPDATE`), against live queues:
12 jobs on a queue with no worker showed as depth 12, an empty queue as 0; the oldest age read 40 s
then 50 s as time passed; five jobs that exhausted their retries showed as five terminal failures
and five waiting in the dead-letter queue; three jobs sitting between attempts showed as three
retrying. Each was compared with the same fact read from SQL. The time-series panels read
`pgboss.queue_stats`, which needs `persistQueueStats` — see F8; they are therefore usable only
where the role that runs pg-boss owns the schema (local development, or a product that accepts
that), and the table panels (retrying, dead-letter) are usable everywhere.

**Scenario 6, OpenTelemetry path — the one products use.** Grafana Cloud cannot open a connection
into a private CloudNativePG cluster, and the platform already ships telemetry as OTLP through
Alloy. pg-boss emits, with no code from us, `pgboss.queue.jobs` (a gauge per queue and per state:
deferred, ready, blocked, active, failed), `messaging.client.sent.messages`,
`messaging.client.consumed.messages`, `messaging.client.operation.duration` and
`messaging.process.duration` (with an `error.type` attribute on failures). The gauge read 7 for
seven waiting jobs; the sent counter read exactly the 14 jobs sent. What it lacks is the age (F9)
and the dead-letter count, which is `ready` on the dead-letter queue, so an alert on
`pgboss.queue.jobs{state="ready"}` for queues named `*.dlq` covers it.

## Not verified

- **Grafana Cloud panels over the OTLP metrics.** Verified: the instruments and their values at
  the SDK. Not verified: Alloy, Mimir, or a panel/alert built on them.
- **CloudNativePG, PgBouncer, a real pod drain.** The drain is a SIGTERM to a process, not a
  kubelet. `useListenNotify` (needs a session-pinned connection) was not tried and is not needed.
- **`ROLE=worker` gating, the Nest module, the shared shutdown hook** — WP-7 and WP-3 scope.
- **Full-length behaviour of scenario 4** (a real daily tick). The tick was shortened to one
  minute; timezone arithmetic was checked by preview, not by waiting a day.
- **Table bloat over weeks.** 10 minutes of load is not a month of retention.
- **pg-boss 12.37.1.** All runs used 12.37.0.

## Decisions by the platform lead (2026-10-09)

1. **`persistQueueStats`: always off.** The app role never owns the `pgboss` schema (the migrator
   role does), and one supervision mechanism is enough: queue depth, oldest-job age, failures,
   retries and dead-letter counts come from the OpenTelemetry metrics. No per-product exception.
2. **Idempotency key → job id**, not `singletonKey` (finding F6). `APP-PLATFORM-PLAN.md` §6.7 is
   updated accordingly.
3. **Per-queue retention is required.** Queues declare `retention` (completed / failed /
   dead-letter). `mail.send` deletes completed jobs immediately and keeps failed or dead-lettered jobs
   at most 24 h (identity ADR 0002 decision 4). Because deleting a completed job also removes the
   job-id dedupe, the `mail.send` handler checks its own idempotency store (key
   `purpose:userId:sha256(token)` from identity) before sending.
4. **Drain-safe retries:** the minimum `retryLimit` is 1 for every queue, because a pod drain costs
   the interrupted job one attempt (finding). A queue that truly must not retry declares it
   explicitly and accepts dead-lettering on drain.
5. **Fetching is batched with burst on** (pg-boss moves one job per second per queue by default);
   long jobs use a heartbeat (30 s) rather than relying on the lease alone.
6. **Defaults for `retryLimit`, `retryDelay`/backoff and `concurrency`** are chosen by the WP-7
   author from the findings, documented with their rationale in the package README, and overridable
   per queue. They are starting points, re-tuned after the first month on the server.
7. pg-boss types are not re-exported from `platform-jobs` (they need `skipLibCheck`).
8. Not verified here, to verify on the server before the first product depends on it: CloudNativePG
   (and a PgBouncer Pooler if one is ever added), a real kubelet drain, table growth over weeks, and
   the Grafana Cloud dashboards over the OTLP metrics.

## Amendment 2026-10-10 (WP-7 implementation and review; platform lead)

Building `platform-jobs` against pg-boss 12.37.0 showed four things the spike could not, and the
platform lead decided each. Where this section and an earlier one differ, this one governs.

1. **Retention is one clock per queue.** pg-boss deletes every _finished_ job of a queue
   (completed, and failed after its retries) on a single `deleteAfterSeconds`. So `retention.completed`
   and `retention.failed` cannot differ by number; `failed` follows `completed` (7 days by default).
   A queue that needs to keep failures longer than successes uses `completed: 'immediate'` (the row is
   deleted the moment the handler succeeds) and sets `failed`; `mail.send` does exactly that
   (`failed` 24 h). The "failures kept 30 days" intent is carried by the **dead-letter copy**, whose
   default retention is **30 days** (was 365 days in the first implementation). That also bounds how
   long a failed payload (personal data) lingers. A waiting dead-letter job is deleted at its
   `keep_until`, so "until handled" is not literal: the alert on the dead-letter queue's depth is the
   real control. This amends decision 3 and the plan's "failed 30 days".
2. **Deletion interval.** pg-boss deletes finished jobs past their retention only every
   `maintenanceIntervalSeconds`, whose default is **24 hours** ("at most 24 h" would mean up to 48).
   `platform-jobs` sets **15 minutes**. Accepted.
3. **Detecting a dead worker takes about 75 seconds plus the expiry.** Lease expiry and heartbeat
   failure are checked by the monitor pass, which pg-boss claims per queue every
   `monitorIntervalSeconds` (default 60 s); the supervise interval of F10 does not change it. A killed
   worker's job therefore comes back after its lease (or, with a heartbeat, about one heartbeat of
   silence) **plus up to ~75 s** (monitor 60 s plus a supervise pass). Measured with the monitor
   shortened: 7 s for a 4 s lease and 12 s for a 10 s heartbeat. **Accepted by the platform lead; the
   monitor interval stays at pg-boss's default**, because the same pass runs a whole-table statistics
   aggregate whose cost at a shorter interval has not been measured. This amends F4 and F10.
4. **A batch must not fail a job that already succeeded.** pg-boss settles a batch only when every
   handler in it has returned, and on a drain past the budget, or when one job outlives the batch's
   lease, it fails every job it still holds. A job that had succeeded would be retried and its side
   effect run again on every deploy that catches a long job. `platform-jobs` therefore **completes
   (or, for `'immediate'`, deletes) each job, fenced to the attempt fetched, as soon as its handler
   returns**; the later batch settle finds it settled. This amends F5.

Also decided:

- **`PermanentJobError`.** A handler that throws it sends the job straight to the dead-letter queue
  with no retries (`perJobResults: 'deadletter'`). `drainQueue` honours it.
- **Concurrency model accepted:** `batchSize = concurrency`, `localConcurrency = 1`, so at most
  `concurrency` jobs are in flight. One slow job holds its batch's other slots; long jobs get their
  own queue.
- **API additions to the sketch:** `defineQueue()` (a process that only enqueues must define the queue;
  awaited when called after `start()`), `acceptDeadLetterOnDrain` (how a queue declares it will not
  retry), `jobs.once()` and `pgboss.platform_effect` (the handler-side guard, in the one schema this
  package owns; its effect runs inside a savepoint, and it must never hold an external call),
  `installJobsSchema()` (the migration Job's step, using pg-boss's own install path under one advisory
  lock, rather than running the `getConstructionPlans` SQL).
- **Metrics** are emitted on the platform-contract names (`queue.processed`, `queue.failures`,
  `queue.lag_seconds` = age of the oldest ready job) through `observability`'s `QueueMetrics`, with
  pg-boss's own `pgboss.*` instruments and `pgboss.queue.oldest_ready_age` as extras.

## Amendment 2026-10-10 (jobs nobody processed; issue #192)

The retention of decision 3 covered jobs that are _finished_ and dead-letter copies. It missed a third
kind: a job that is **never fetched** (no worker, a worker that is down) or is waiting to be retried is
deleted by pg-boss at its own `keep_until`, which defaults to **14 days**, so a `mail.send` job kept its
bearer link in clear for up to 14 days against the 24 h that identity ADR 0002 decision 4 sets.
`platform-jobs` adds `retention.pending` (seconds; maps to the queue's `retentionSeconds`; default
unchanged) and `platform-mail` sets it to 24 h. What pg-boss does, verified against PostgreSQL 18: the
deadline is `start_after + pending`, fixed when the job is inserted and copied unchanged on every retry
(**a retry does not extend it**, so a queue whose window is shorter than its retries can take, with
the lateness of expiry detection added, is refused); a job being processed is never deleted by it; there is no dead-letter copy; changing the
setting does not touch jobs already waiting. A worker deletes the drops when it starts and every minute, under pg-boss's own deletion lock, and
reports them (a count per queue, never a payload, and `queue.pending_dropped`) for the queues that
set it. The report is best effort and a **lower bound**: pg-boss's own maintenance, every 15 minutes
on any worker, deletes expired jobs silently, and whoever deletes first wins.

## Amendment 2026-10-10 (WP-8 `platform-mail`; its author)

Written by the author of `platform-mail` against `platform-jobs` as merged. It records what the mail
queue decided and why, and amends nothing above: decision 3's handler-side guard is implemented here
the way the Amendment of WP-7 (`jobs.once` must never hold an external call) already points.

1. **The `mail.send` send ledger is in Valkey, not behind `jobs.once`.** `once(db, key, effect)` runs
   its effect inside a database transaction (a savepoint of the caller's) and keeps that transaction
   and the marker's row lock for as long as the effect runs. The effect here is an HTTP request to
   Microsoft Graph, which PLAN §4.3 forbids inside an open transaction, and no transaction can make an
   external call atomic with a marker. The handler therefore keeps a **claim ledger**: claim (atomic
   `SET`-if-absent with a lease) → send → record (7 days) → release on failure. It lives in the
   product's own Valkey, keyed by the sender mailbox and a hash of the idempotency key
   (`purpose:userId:sha256(token)` from identity), and adds no table to the product's database (P6).
   It is a guard, not a record: losing it can cost one duplicate email, never a lost one. This is why
   PLATFORM-CONTRACT §11 ("the cache is never the source of truth") carries a note for it.
2. **Delivery is at-least-once, with duplicates preferred to losses.** Graph has no idempotency key, so
   a message accepted by Graph whose acknowledgement is lost is sent again by the retry. The ledger
   narrows that to the moment between Graph's `202` and the ledger write. A failed ledger write after a
   successful send is logged, not thrown.
3. **One queue definition.** `MAIL_QUEUE_CONFIG` is used by the worker (`handle`) and by every process
   that only enqueues (`defineQueue`), so identity's API pods create `mail.send` exactly as the worker
   does; `platform-jobs` throws if they differ. Retention is `{ completed: 'immediate', failed: 86400,
deadLetter: 86400 }`, the lease is `expireInSeconds` (300) with an explicit 30 s heartbeat. The ledger claim
   is **not** tied to that ceiling: it is leased for 60 s and renewed every 30 s (token-checked) while
   the send runs, so a worker killed mid-send frees its claim within a minute. (A first version held it
   for `expireInSeconds + 30`; a SIGKILL probe showed the dead worker's claim then bounced four
   redeliveries and delayed the mail about nine minutes.)
4. **The retry window is at least an hour.** `retryLimit` 10, `retryDelaySeconds` 10,
   `retryDelayMaxSeconds` 900. pg-boss waits `min(max, delay × 2ⁿ × (1 + random))`; with `random` at 0
   the ten waits sum to 66 minutes (10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, 640, then 900 three times). A ten-minute
   Valkey outage, a killed worker whose stale claim has to expire, or sustained throttling must not
   dead-letter a password reset.
5. **Permanent failures dead-letter at once** (`PermanentJobError`): HTTP 400, 403, 404, 413 and an
   invalid payload. Everything else is retried. `retryAfterSeconds` from a `429` does not reschedule
   the job; it starts a **mailbox-wide cooldown** in the shared state that every worker honours before
   sending.
6. **Priority by category.** `auth.*` messages are enqueued with priority 10, everything else 0, so a
   bulk run cannot delay a verification link. Bulk mail must stay at 0.
7. **Registration.** In NestJS the handler is a provider with `@JobHandler(MAIL_QUEUE, …)`, which
   `JobsModule` registers before it starts pg-boss. In the core, the order of `registerMailJobs` against
   `jobs.start()` does not matter (`platform-jobs` starts a handler registered after `start()` at once).

## Consequences

- **Good:** WP-7 proceeds as planned. The business write and its job commit or roll back together;
  there is no broker to run, back up or secure. The platform needs no new infrastructure.
- **Bad / costs:** a smaller community than BullMQ and no official dashboard (the SQL dashboard and
  OTel gauges cover it); three pg-boss defaults are wrong for us (F2, F8, F10) and WP-7 owns that;
  a deploy can cost a long job one retry (F5).
- **Follow-ups:**
  - WP-7 owner: build the API below; update APP-PLATFORM-PLAN §6.7 (idempotency maps to the job
    id, not `singletonKey`; no KEDA is already there) and §6.2 (migration Job also runs the pg-boss
    install SQL and the grants above).
  - WP-3 owner: the shutdown hook passes `stop({ graceful: true, timeout })` a budget derived from
    the pod grace period.
  - WP-8 owner: the `mail.send` handler uses the idempotency pattern in F6.
  - Platform lead: decide whether a product whose app role owns the pgboss schema may turn
    `persistQueueStats` on (F8); the default says no.

## API sketch for WP-7

Core is framework-agnostic; `/nest` adds the module. Products never import `pg-boss` (F11).

```ts
// @quynhonsemiconductor/platform-jobs
export interface JobsOptions {
  /** Pool from platform-db, dedicated and small (max 5). pg-boss never opens its own. */
  pool: Pool;
  /** From env, not an option: ROLE=worker registers handlers and runs supervise + schedules;
   *  anything else only enqueues (start() with supervise:false, schedule:false). */
}

export interface Jobs {
  /** Fails fast if the pgboss schema is missing or older than this code (migrate:false). */
  start(): Promise<void>;
  /** Graceful: stop fetching, wait up to `timeoutMs`, fail the rest. Called by the shutdown hook. */
  stop(timeoutMs: number): Promise<void>;

  send<T extends object>(
    queue: string,
    data: T,
    options?: {
      tx?: DbExecutor; // platform-db: root database or an open transaction
      idempotencyKey?: string; // → deterministic UUIDv5(queue, key) used as the job id (F6)
      startAfter?: Date | number; // seconds from now, or a date
      priority?: number;
    },
  ): Promise<string | null>; // null = duplicate key, nothing inserted

  schedule(
    name: string,
    cron: string,
    data?: object,
    options?: { tz?: string }, // default 'Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh'
  ): Promise<void>;

  /** Registers a handler. No-op unless ROLE=worker. */
  handle<T extends object>(
    queue: string,
    handler: (job: { id: string; data: T; attempt: number; signal: AbortSignal }) => Promise<void>,
    options?: {
      concurrency?: number; // default 4  → localConcurrency
      pollingIntervalSeconds?: number; // default 1, minimum 0.5
      expireInSeconds?: number; // ceiling on run time, default 900
      heartbeatSeconds?: number; // default 30 when expireInSeconds > 300 (F4)
      retryLimit?: number; // default 3, minimum 1 (F5)
      retryDelaySeconds?: number; // default 5, with backoff
      deadLetter?: string; // default `${queue}.dlq`, created for you
    },
  ): Promise<void>;
}

// Behaviour fixed by the spike, not options:
//  - fetch batchSize = concurrency, burstWhenBatchFull: true                       (F2)
//  - migrate:false, createSchema:false; persistQueueStats:false; no partition:true  (F8)
//  - superviseIntervalSeconds: 15                                                   (F10)
//  - queues are created idempotently at start, shared table, with the retention
//    defaults of §6.7: completed 7 days, failed 30 days, dead-letter kept until handled
//  - observability registers the oldest-ready-age gauge (F9) next to pgboss.queue.jobs

// @quynhonsemiconductor/platform-jobs/testing
export function drainQueue(jobs: Jobs, queue: string): Promise<void>;
export function runInline<T extends object>(jobs: Jobs, queue: string, data: T): Promise<void>;
```

The migrator step of `platform-db`/WP-2 installs the schema with `getConstructionPlans('pgboss')`
and runs the grants in F8. `platform-jobs` has no schema of its own (P6).

Open choices WP-7 must make that this spike does not settle: the exact default of `retryLimit`,
`concurrency` and `retryDelaySeconds` (above are starting points, chosen from F2 and F5, not
measured optima), and whether `handle` accepts a batch for high-throughput queues.
