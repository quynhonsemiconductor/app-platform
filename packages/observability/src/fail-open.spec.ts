/**
 * These assertions belong to the package because the guarantee belongs to the
 * package: consumers point a CloudWatch metric filter at `$.securityFailOpen`,
 * and nothing in their own code can stop this helper from emitting a different
 * shape. They previously lived in rova's repo, which meant the second consumer
 * inherited the behaviour without inheriting the guard.
 *
 * What CANNOT move here is the other half of the contract — that a consumer's
 * Terraform actually filters on the field. Each app repo asserts that against its
 * own `infra/` tree (rova: `libs/platform/src/observability/fail-open.spec.ts`),
 * because the package has no infrastructure to inspect. A repo adopting this
 * package needs its own copy of that check, or its alarm is disarmed while the app
 * still emits the field.
