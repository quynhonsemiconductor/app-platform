/**
 * ExclusiveJob — run a scheduled job on exactly one pod, with a correlation id and
 * duration/outcome metrics.
 *
 * @deprecated Use `platform-jobs` schedules (`jobs.schedule(name, cron, data)`): pg-boss runs a
 * singleton schedule once per tick in the product's own database, with retries and dead-letter,
 * which this helper cannot offer. Kept for the products that still use `@Cron`; removal is
 * planned for the next `platform-runtime` major, after every product has converged (WP-15).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * `@Cron` and `@Interval` fire on EVERY replica. With one worker replica that is invisible;
 * the moment a rolling deploy overlaps two replicas, or the worker scales past one, every job
 * runs twice concurrently. That is not academic here: `audit-cleanup` deletes rows and
 * `storage-cleanup` deletes objects. `@Interval` is the worse of the two, because interval
 * timers start when the pod starts and therefore drift independently — two pods never even
 * collide predictably enough to notice in a log.
 *
 * A SERVICE, NOT A COPIED BLOCK: the lock/log/finally/metrics sequence is identical for
 * every job, and there are eight of them. Inlining it would be eight chances to forget the
 * `finally` and leave a lock held for its whole TTL.
 *
 * WITHOUT A CACHE, THE LOCK MOVES TO POSTGRES. `CacheService.tryLock` returns `null` both
 * when another pod holds the lock AND when there is no cache client at all, so treating a
 * false as "someone else has it" means a Valkey outage silently stops every scheduled job in
 * the system while logging that another pod is doing the work. So when the cache is not
 * available the job takes a Postgres advisory lock instead (`withAdvisoryLock` from
 * `platform-db`): a tick still runs once across replicas, and a crashed holder frees the lock
 * the moment its connection drops. It needs no Valkey, only the database the product has anyway.
 *
 * Only when there is NEITHER a cache NOR a database pool does it fail OPEN and run the job
 * unlocked, logging at ERROR and counting it in `job.unlocked_runs`. Leader election is then impossible, and losing SLA-breach
 * detection for the length of an incident is worse than running a sweep twice: every job
 * behind this helper is idempotent (deletes filter on age or orphan status, syncs re-read
 * from the source).
 *
 * KNOWN LIMIT: if the cache is down for ONE pod only (its own connection flapping) while
 * another pod still holds a cache lock, the two use different locks and may overlap. That is
 * strictly narrower than the old behaviour, where every pod with a flapping cache ran unlocked.
