/**
 * Metric instruments, shared across products.
 *
 * Two rules drive the whole design, and both come from watching metric layers rot:
 *
 * 1. **Names live here, not at call sites.** A previous attempt declared 23 metric
 *    names in a constants file and implemented none of them — the names implied
 *    coverage that did not exist. Every name below is emitted by a real recorder.
 *
 * 2. **Labels are bounded by construction.** The single most common cause of both
 *    observability outages and surprise bills is an id in a metric label. The
 *    recorder signatures below only accept low-cardinality values, so passing a
 *    workspace id or a raw URL is a type error rather than a production incident.
 *    IDs belong on spans and logs, which is where they are useful anyway.
 *
 * Every instrument is a no-op when OTel is disabled — the API returns no-op
 * instruments — so products can emit unconditionally.
