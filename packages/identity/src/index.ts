/**
 * `@quynhonsemiconductor/identity`
 *
 * Shared AUTHENTICATION mechanism for QNSC product backends: the refresh-rotation
 * auth service with family theft-detection, Entra/SSO token verification,
 * refresh-token crypto, the access-token denylist, the ES256 JWT Passport
 * strategy + auth guard, and the Backend-for-Frontend Entra OIDC login mechanism
 * (session store, OIDC client, orchestrator).
 *
 * AUTHORIZATION is deliberately absent. Permission codes, wildcard semantics and
 * scope models are product vocabulary — each product owns its own catalogue and
 * guard, and both do. See the README's "Not in scope".
 *
 * Products own their HTTP surface too: controllers, DTOs, route names and cookie
 * names. This package supplies the services those controllers call.
