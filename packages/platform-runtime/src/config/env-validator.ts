/**
 * Environment validation for `ConfigModule.forRoot`'s `validate` hook.
 *
 * Both products wrote the same function: run the schema, and on failure throw an
 * `Error` whose message lists every offending key on its own line. The value is in
 * the FAILURE path — a bad deploy should say which four variables are missing, not
 * fail on the first one and hide the rest behind another deploy cycle.
 *
 * STRUCTURALLY TYPED, NOT ZOD-TYPED — deliberately. Taking `ZodSchema` would make
 * this package carry a zod peer dependency and pin every consumer to the same major.
 * The two members used here (`safeParse`, and `error.issues`) are all a validator
 * needs to expose, so the contract is written out below and any library satisfying it
 * works. `zod@4`'s `safeParse` matches it exactly.
