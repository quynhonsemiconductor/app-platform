/**
 * Every releasable package must be wired into BOTH release-please and the publish
 * workflow.
 *
 * This exists because it was missed. `platform-runtime` was registered in
 * `release-please-config.json` but not added to `publish.yml`'s tag allowlist, so
 * release-please computed the version, tagged `platform-runtime-v0.1.1`, and cut a
 * GitHub Release — and no workflow fired. Nothing failed. The package simply was
 * not on the registry, which only surfaced when a consumer tried to install it.
 *
 * That is the same "real in three places, forgotten in the fourth" failure this org
 * already writes down for env vars, and a silent one: the allowlist is deliberate
 * (the workflow holds publish credentials), so it cannot be replaced with a wildcard
 * and will keep needing a manual edit per package. This test is the reminder.
