 * Serve `/livez` and `/readyz` (plus the legacy `/v1/healthz` and `/v1/readyz`).

 * const app = await NestFactory.create<NestFastifyApplication>(AppModule, new FastifyAdapter());
 * enableHealth(app);
 * enableGracefulShutdown(app);
 * await app.listen(port, '0.0.0.0');
 * ```
 *
 * WHY RAW FASTIFY ROUTES AND NOT A NEST CONTROLLER. A controller inherits the product's global
 * prefix (`/v1/livez` is a rejected manifest, not a lesser option), its global guards (which
 * would answer 401 to the kubelet unless the product's own `@Public()` decorator, a name this
 * package cannot know, were applied), its rate limiter, and its OpenAPI document (a new path
 * there breaks every committed-client diff check). Routes registered on the Fastify instance
 * sit outside all of that, which is exactly what a contract with the kubelet should do.
 * It also means the product deletes its own health controller rather than configuring this one.
 *
 * - `/livez` answers 200 while the process runs. It touches NO dependency (the cascading-failure
 *   trap: liveness that checks the database restarts every replica at once when it slows down)
 *   and it stays 200 through the endpoint-removal delay after shutdown begins. (Once the server
 *   stops listening to drain, nothing answers; the pod is Terminating and is not probed.)
 * - `/readyz` runs the registered checks and answers 503 when any is down, and always 503
 *   once shutdown has begun. Built in: `database` when `platform-db` provides a pool, `cache`
 *   when a Valkey URL is configured. Add product checks through `options.checks`.
 * - The body carries per-check up/down only. `/readyz` is unauthenticated; host names, role
 *   names and error text go to the log, not the response.
